Build a Deck

Use a forEach() loop within another forEach() loop to build an array representing a deck of cards. A deck consists of 52 cards - 13 ranks in each of 4 suits.
Then, display a list of every card in the deck. (Hint: Each element of the array should read something like "ace of spades" or "4 of hearts").
